## Abstract

Research into the complex behavioral abilities of non-neuronal organisms, whether through plant intelligence studies or investigation into fungal communication, is allowing these organisms to be examined through a cognitive science lens. Physarum polycephalum, a plasmodial slime mold, is a popular model organism for these types of studies. While previous studies have shown P. polycephalum to exhibit complex cognitive processes such as maze solving and habituation to negative stimuli, its learning and memory capabilities are still not well understood. Here we ask the question: Does P. polycephalum use memory to inform growth as it repeatedly solves a maze? We investigated this question by conducting a 2-month experimental maze study, collecting data on growth efficiency, growth down dead-ended paths, and growth over maze walls to assess changes in locomotive behavior as P. polycephalum repeatedly solved the same labyrinth. We found a significant increase in efficiency, and a significant decrease in both dead-end paths and wall jumping, as maze repetitions increased. This points to evidence of information storage and retrieval, and therefore cognitive processes such as memory, within the single-cellular protist Physarum polycephalum.  

Here you will find statistical analysis written in the R programming language. Cleaned and completed code can be found in Manuscript-Annotated.R, and raw data is in Data2_v2.csv. Other projects were left to provide insight into the statistical analysis and graphical visualization process, if desired!
